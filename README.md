# Orchestrator_MAS
## A Multi Agent System to orchestrate the Production Order on the Assembly Line.

Brief Description:
When a company has a bulk order of mobile phones to be manufactured that process needs to be automated keeping in view the delivery time.
This orchestrator increases the efficiency of the manufacturing, by controlling the way products (mobile phones) are created on the assembly line.
It manages how a certain pallet moves across the assembly line, on which station product will be assembled and what will be the design based on the user oreder provided in StartServer.js file.

The Manufacturing system used as test-bed for this orchestrator is a 12 station production line installed in FAST Lab of Tampere University of Technology. It provides discrete operations via RestFUL services. More details about the digital twin of FASTory Line and RESTful API's can be found here: http://escop.rd.tut.fi:3000/
